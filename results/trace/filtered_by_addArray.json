        "message": "[Fabric] Pass children when cloning (#27458)\n\n## Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently when cloning nodes in Fabric, we reset a node's children on\r\neach clone, and then repeatedly call appendChild to restore the previous\r\nlist of children (even if it was quasi-identical to before). This causes\r\nunnecessary invalidation of the layout state in Fabric's ShadowNode data\r\n(which in turn may require additional yoga clones) and extra JSI calls.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a feature flag to pass in the children as part of the clone\r\ncall, so Fabric always has a complete view of the node that's being\r\nmutated.\r\n\r\nThis feature flag requires matching changes in the react-native repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/39817\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nUnit test added demonstrates the new behaviour \r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn test -r www-modern ReactFabric-test\r\nyarn test ReactFabric-test.internal\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested a manual sync into React Native and verified core surfaces render\r\ncorrectly.",

For example,\r\nthese two trees produce the same ids:\r\n\r\n<>                          <>\r\n  <Indirection>               <A />\r\n    <A />                     <B />\r\n  </Indirection>            </>\r\n  <B />\r\n</>\r\n\r\nHowever, we cannot skip any materializes an id. Otherwise, a parent id\r\nthat does not fork would be indistinguishable from its child id. For\r\nexample, this tree does not fork, but the parent and child must have\r\ndifferent ids.\r\n\r\n<Parent>\r\n  <Child />\r\n</Parent>\r\n\r\nTo handle this scenario, every time we materialize an id, we allocate a\r\nnew level with a single slot. You can think of this as a fork with only\r\none prong, or an array of children with length 1.\r\n\r\nIt's possible for the the size of the sequence to exceed 32 bits, the\r\nmax size for bitwise operations. When this happens, we make more room by\r\nconverting the right part of the id to a string and storing it in an\r\noverflow variable. We use a base 32 string representation, because 32 is\r\nthe largest power of 2 that is supported by toString(). We want the base\r\nto be large so that the resulting ids are compact, and we want the base\r\nto be a power of 2 because every log2(base) bits corresponds to a single\r\ncharacter, i.e. every log2(32) = 5 bits. That means we can lop bits off\r\nthe end 5 at a time without affecting the final result.\r\n\r\n* Incremental hydration\r\n\r\nStores the tree context on the dehydrated Suspense boundary's state\r\nobject so it resume where it left off.\r\n\r\n* Add useId to react-debug-tools\r\n\r\n* Add selective hydration test\r\n\r\nDemonstrates that selective hydration works and ids are preserved even\r\nafter subsequent client updates.",

        "message": "Add `React.useActionState` (#28491)\n\n## Overview\r\n\r\n_Depends on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28514_\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new React hook called `useActionState` to replace and\r\nimprove the ReactDOM `useFormState` hook.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis hook intends to fix some of the confusion and limitations of the\r\n`useFormState` hook.\r\n\r\nThe `useFormState` hook is only exported from the `ReactDOM` package and\r\nimplies that it is used only for the state of `<form>` actions, similar\r\nto `useFormStatus` (which is only for `<form>` element status). This\r\nleads to understandable confusion about why `useFormState` does not\r\nprovide a `pending` state value like `useFormStatus` does.\r\n\r\nThe key insight is that the `useFormState` hook does not actually return\r\nthe state of any particular form at all. Instead, it returns the state\r\nof the _action_ passed to the hook, wrapping it and returning a\r\ntrackable action to add to a form, and returning the last returned value\r\nof the action given. In fact, `useFormState` doesn't need to be used in\r\na `<form>` at all.\r\n\r\nThus, adding a `pending` value to `useFormState` as-is would thus be\r\nconfusing because it would only return the pending state of the _action_\r\ngiven, not the `<form>` the action is passed to. Even if we wanted to\r\ntie them together, the returned `action` can be passed to multiple\r\nforms, creating confusing and conflicting pending states during multiple\r\nform submissions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since the action is not related to any particular\r\n`<form>`, the hook can be used in any renderer - not only `react-dom`.\r\nFor example, React Native could use the hook to wrap an action, pass it\r\nto a component that will unwrap it, and return the form result state and\r\npending state. It's renderer agnostic.\r\n\r\nTo fix these issues, this PR:\r\n- Renames `useFormState` to `useActionState`\r\n- Adds a `pending` state to the returned tuple\r\n- Moves the hook to the `'react'` package\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\nThe `useFormState` hook allows you to track the pending state and return\r\nvalue of a function (called an \"action\"). The function passed can be a\r\nplain JavaScript client function, or a bound server action to a\r\nreference on the server. It accepts an optional `initialState` value\r\nused for the initial render, and an optional `permalink` argument for\r\nrenderer specific pre-hydration handling (such as a URL to support\r\nprogressive hydration in `react-dom`).\r\n\r\nType:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction useActionState<State>(\r\n        action: (state: Awaited<State>) => State | Promise<State>,\r\n        initialState: Awaited<State>,\r\n        permalink?: string,\r\n    ): [state: Awaited<State>, dispatch: () => void, boolean];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe hook returns a tuple with:\r\n- `state`: the last state the action returned\r\n- `dispatch`: the method to call to dispatch the wrapped action\r\n- `pending`: the pending state of the action and any state updates\r\ncontained\r\n\r\nNotably, state updates inside of the action dispatched are wrapped in a\r\ntransition to keep the page responsive while the action is completing\r\nand the UI is updated based on the result.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe `useActionState` hook can be used similar to `useFormState`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useActionState } from \"react\"; // not react-dom\r\n\r\nfunction Form({ formAction }) {\r\n  const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(formAction);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <form action={action}>\r\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" disabled={isPending} />\r\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isPending}>\r\n        Submit\r\n      </button>\r\n      {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}\r\n    </form>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't need to be used with a `<form/>` (neither did\r\n`useFormState`, hence the confusion):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useActionState, useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Form({ someAction }) {\r\n  const ref = useRef(null);\r\n  const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(someAction);\r\n\r\n  async function handleSubmit() {\r\n    // See caveats below\r\n    await action({ email: ref.current.value });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={ref} type=\"email\" name=\"email\" disabled={isPending} />\r\n      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>\r\n        Submit\r\n      </button>\r\n      {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\nOne of the benefits of using this hook is the automatic tracking of the\r\nreturn value and pending states of the wrapped function. For example,\r\nthe above example could be accomplished via:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useActionState, useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Form({ someAction }) {\r\n  const ref = useRef(null);\r\n  const [state, setState] = useState(null);\r\n  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useTransition();\r\n\r\n  function handleSubmit() {\r\n    startTransition(async () => {\r\n      const response = await someAction({ email: ref.current.value });\r\n      setState(response);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={ref} type=\"email\" name=\"email\" disabled={isPending} />\r\n      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>\r\n        Submit\r\n      </button>\r\n      {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this hook adds more benefits when used with render specific\r\nelements like react-dom `<form>` elements and Server Action. With\r\n`<form>` elements, React will automatically support replay actions on\r\nthe form if it is submitted before hydration has completed, providing a\r\nform of partial progressive enhancement: enhancement for when javascript\r\nis enabled but not ready.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with the `permalink` argument and Server Actions,\r\nframeworks can provide full progressive enhancement support, submitting\r\nthe form to the URL provided along with the FormData from the form. On\r\nsubmission, the Server Action will be called during the MPA navigation,\r\nsimilar to any raw HTML app, server rendered, and the result returned to\r\nthe client without any JavaScript on the client.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\nThere are a few Caveats to this new hook:\r\n**Additional state update**: Since we cannot know whether you use the\r\npending state value returned by the hook, the hook will always set the\r\n`isPending` state at the beginning of the first chained action,\r\nresulting in an additional state update similar to `useTransition`. In\r\nthe future a type-aware compiler could optimize this for when the\r\npending state is not accessed.\r\n\r\n**Pending state is for the action, not the handler**: The difference is\r\nsubtle but important, the pending state begins when the return action is\r\ndispatched and will revert back after all actions and transitions have\r\nsettled. The mechanism for this under the hook is the same as\r\nuseOptimisitic.\r\n\r\nConcretely, what this means is that the pending state of\r\n`useActionState` will not represent any actions or sync work performed\r\nbefore dispatching the action returned by `useActionState`. Hopefully\r\nthis is obvious based on the name and shape of the API, but there may be\r\nsome temporary confusion.\r\n\r\nAs an example, let's take the above example and await another action\r\ninside of it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useActionState, useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {\r\n  const ref = useRef(null);\r\n  const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(someAction);\r\n\r\n  async function handleSubmit() {\r\n    await someOtherAction();\r\n\r\n    // The pending state does not start until this call.\r\n    await action({ email: ref.current.value });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={ref} type=\"email\" name=\"email\" disabled={isPending} />\r\n      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>\r\n        Submit\r\n      </button>\r\n      {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the pending state is related to the action, and not the handler or\r\nform it's attached to, the pending state only changes when the action is\r\ndispatched. To solve, there are two options.\r\n\r\nFirst (recommended): place the other function call inside of the action\r\npassed to `useActionState`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useActionState, useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {\r\n  const ref = useRef(null);\r\n  const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(async (data) => {\r\n    // Pending state is true already.\r\n    await someOtherAction();\r\n    return someAction(data);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  async function handleSubmit() {\r\n    // The pending state starts at this call.\r\n    await action({ email: ref.current.value });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={ref} type=\"email\" name=\"email\" disabled={isPending} />\r\n      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>\r\n        Submit\r\n      </button>\r\n      {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor greater control, you can also wrap both in a transition and use the\r\n`isPending` state of the transition:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useActionState, useTransition, useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Form({ someAction, someOtherAction }) {\r\n  const ref = useRef(null);\r\n\r\n  // isPending is used from the transition wrapping both action calls.\r\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\r\n\r\n  // isPending not used from the individual action.\r\n  const [state, action] = useActionState(someAction);\r\n\r\n  async function handleSubmit() {\r\n    startTransition(async () => {\r\n      // The transition pending state has begun.\r\n      await someOtherAction();\r\n      await action({ email: ref.current.value });\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={ref} type=\"email\" name=\"email\" disabled={isPending} />\r\n      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>\r\n        Submit\r\n      </button>\r\n      {state.errorMessage && <p>{state.errorMessage}</p>}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA similar technique using `useOptimistic` is preferred over using\r\n`useTransition` directly, and is left as an exercise to the reader.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to @ryanflorence @mjackson @wesbos\r\n(https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/27980#issuecomment-1960685940)\r\nand [Allan\r\nLasser](https://allanlasser.com/posts/2024-01-26-avoid-using-reacts-useformstatus)\r\nfor their feedback and suggestions on `useFormStatus` hook.",

        "message": "Add useSwipeTransition Hook Behind Experimental Flag (#32373)\n\nThis Hook will be used to drive a View Transition based on a gesture.\n\n```js\nconst [value, startGesture] = useSwipeTransition(prev, current, next);\n```\n\nThe `enableSwipeTransition` flag will depend on `enableViewTransition`\nflag but we may decide to ship them independently. This PR doesn't do\nanything interesting yet. There will be a lot more PRs to build out the\nactual functionality. This is just wiring up the plumbing for the new\nHook.\n\nThis first PR is mainly concerned with how the whole starts (and stops).\nThe core API is the `startGesture` function (although there will be\nother conveniences added in the future). You can call this to start a\ngesture with a source provider. You can call this multiple times in one\nevent to batch multiple Hooks listening to the same provider. However,\neach render can only handle one source provider at a time and so it does\none render per scheduled gesture provider.\n\nThis uses a separate `GestureLane` to drive gesture renders by marking\nthe Hook as having an update on that lane. Then schedule a render. These\nrenders should be blocking and in the same microtask as the\n`startGesture` to ensure it can block the paint. So it's similar to\nsync.\n\nIt may not be possible to finish it synchronously e.g. if something\nsuspends. If so, it just tries again later when it can like any other\nrender. This can also happen because it also may not be possible to\ndrive more than one gesture at a time like if we're limited to one View\nTransition per document. So right now you can only run one gesture at a\ntime in practice.\n\nThese renders never commit. This means that we can't clear the\n`GestureLane` the normal way. Instead, we have to clear only the root's\n`pendingLanes` if we don't have any new renders scheduled. Then wait\nuntil something else updates the Fiber after all gestures on it have\nstopped before it really clears.",

The global\r\nstack can be reset in case of an interruption or error, whereas with the\r\nlinked list implementation, you'd need to keep track of every\r\ncontext type.\r\n\r\n* Put new context API behind a feature flag\r\n\r\nWe'll enable this in www only for now.\r\n\r\n* Store nearest provider on context object\r\n\r\n* Handle reentrancy in server renderer\r\n\r\nContext stack should be per server renderer instance.\r\n\r\n* Bailout of consumer updates using bitmask\r\n\r\nThe context type defines an optional function that compares two context\r\nvalues, returning a bitfield. A consumer may specify the bits it needs\r\nfor rendering. If a provider's context changes, and the consumer's bits\r\ndo not intersect with the changed bits, we can skip the consumer.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to how selectors are used in Redux but fast enough to do\r\nwhile scanning the tree. The only user code involved is the function\r\nthat computes the changed bits. But that's only called once per provider\r\nupdate, not for every consumer.\r\n\r\n* Store current value and changed bits on context object\r\n\r\nThere are fewer providers than consumers, so better to do this work\r\nat the provider.\r\n\r\n* Use maximum of 31 bits for bitmask\r\n\r\nThis is the largest integer size in V8 on 32-bit systems. Warn in\r\ndevelopment if too large a number is used.\r\n\r\n* ProviderComponent -> ContextProvider, ConsumerComponent -> ContextConsumer\r\n\r\n* Inline Object.is\r\n\r\n* Warn if multiple renderers concurrently render the same context provider\r\n\r\nLet's see if we can get away with not supporting this for now. If it\r\nturns out that it's needed, we can fall back to backtracking the\r\nfiber return path.\r\n\r\n* Nits that came up during review",

Because the flight wire format is a\r\nJSON-like serialization that is expected to be rendered it currently\r\nonly describes renderable elements. We need a way to convey a function\r\ninvocation that gets run in the context of the client environment\r\nwhether that is Fizz or Fiber.\r\n\r\nFiber is somewhat straightforward because the HostDispatcher is always\r\nactive and we can just have the FlightClient dispatch the serialized\r\ndirective.\r\n\r\nFizz is much more challenging becaue the dispatcher is always scoped but\r\nthe specific request the dispatch belongs to is not readily available.\r\nEnvironments that support AsyncLocalStorage (or in the future\r\nAsyncContext) we will use this to be able to resolve directives in Fizz\r\nto the appropriate Request. For other environments directives will be\r\nelided. Right now this is pragmatic and non-breaking because all\r\ndirectives are opportunistic and non-critical. If this changes in the\r\nfuture we will need to reconsider how widespread support for async\r\ncontext tracking is.\r\n\r\nFor Flight, if AsyncLocalStorage is available Float methods can be\r\ncalled before and after await points and be expected to work. If\r\nAsyncLocalStorage is not available float methods called in the sync\r\nphase of a component render will be captured but anything after an await\r\npoint will be a noop. If a float call is dropped in this manner a DEV\r\nwarning should help you realize your code may need to be modified.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a way for resources (Fizz) and hints (Flight) to\r\nflush even if there is not active task being worked on. This will help\r\nwhen Float methods are called in between async points within a function\r\nexecution but the task is blocked on the entire function finishing.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces deduping of Hints in Flight using the same\r\nresource keys used in Fizz. This will help shrink payload sizes when the\r\nsame hint is attempted to emit over and over again",

The DOM needs to add separate properties for the object forms\nsince you read back but it doesn't make sense for React's write-only API\nto do that. Similar to how we'll like add an overload for\n`popoverTarget` instead of calling it `popoverTargetElement` and how\n`style` accepts an object and it's not `styleObject={{...}}`.\n\nThere are a number of reason to revisit this.\n\n- It's just way more convenient to have this built-in and it makes\nconceptual sense. We typically support declarative APIs and polyfill\nthem when necessary.\n- RSC supports Blobs and by having it built-in you don't need a Client\nComponent wrapper to render it where as doing it with effects would\nrequire more complex wrappers. By picking Blobs over base64,\nclient-navigations can use the more optimized binary encoding in the RSC\nprotocol.\n- The timing aspect of coordinating it with Suspensey images and image\ndecoding is a bit tricky to get right because if you set it in an effect\nit's too late because you've already rendered it.\n- SSR gets complicated when done in user space because you have to\nhandle both branches.

        "message": "[Fizz] Emit link rel=\"expect\" to block render before the shell has fully loaded (#33016)\n\nThe semantics of React is that anything outside of Suspense boundaries\nin a transition doesn't display until it has fully unsuspended. With SSR\nstreaming the intention is to preserve that.\n\nWe explicitly don't want to support the mode of document streaming\nnormally supported by the browser where it can paint content as tags\nstream in since that leads to content popping in and thrashing in\nunpredictable ways. This should instead be modeled explictly by nested\nSuspense boundaries or something like SuspenseList.\n\nAfter the first shell any nested Suspense boundaries are only revealed,\nby script, once they're fully streamed in to the next boundary. So this\nis already the case there. However, for the initial shell we have been\nat the mercy of browser heuristics for how long it decides to stream\nbefore the first paint.\n\nChromium now has [an API explicitly for this use\ncase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#stabilizing_page_state_to_make_cross-document_transitions_consistent)\nthat lets us model the semantics that we want. This is always important\nbut especially so with MPA View Transitions.\n\nAfter this a simple document looks like this:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n     <link rel=\"expect\" href=\"#«R»\" blocking=\"render\"/>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>hello world</p>\n    <script src=\"bootstrap.js\" id=\"«R»\" async=\"\"></script>\n    ...\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe `rel=\"expect\"` tag indicates that we want to wait to paint until we\nhave streamed far enough to be able to paint the id `\"«R»\"` which\nindicates the shell.\n\nIdeally this `id` would be assigned to the root most HTML element in the\nbody. However, this is tricky in our implementation because there can be\nmultiple and we can render them out of order.\n\nSo instead, we assign the id to the first bootstrap script if there is\none since these are always added to the end of the shell. If there isn't\na bootstrap script then we emit an empty `<template\nid=\"«R»\"></template>` instead as a marker.\n\nSince we currently put as much as possible in the shell if it's loaded\nby the time we render, this can have some negative effects for very\nlarge documents. We should instead apply the heuristic where very large\nSuspense boundaries get outlined outside the shell even if they're\nimmediately available. This means that even prerenders can end up with\nscript tags.\n\nWe only emit the `rel=\"expect\"` if you're rendering a whole document.\nI.e. if you rendered either a `<html>` or `<head>` tag. If you're\nrendering a partial document, then we don't really know where the\nstreaming parts are anyway and can't provide such guarantees. This does\napply whether you're streaming or not because we still want to block\nrendering until the end, but in practice any serialized state that needs\nhydrate should still be embedded after the completion id.",

That helps avoid flashing reveals when a stream reveals many\nindividual steps back to back. It can also improve overall performance\nby batching the layout and paint work that has to happen at each step.\n\nUnfortunately we never implemented this for SSR streaming - only for\nclient navigations. This is highly noticeable on very dynamic sites with\nlots of Suspense boundaries. It can look good with a client nav but feel\nglitchy when you reload the page or initial load.\n\nThis fixes the Fizz runtime to be throttled and reveals batched into a\nsingle paint at a time. We do this by first tracking the last paint\nafter the complete (this will be the first paint if `rel=\"expect\"` is\nrespected). Then in the `completeBoundary` operation we queue the\noperation and then flush it all into a throttled batch.\n\nAnother motivation is that View Transitions need to operate as a batch\nand individual steps get queued in a sequence so it's extra important to\ninclude as much content as possible in each animated step.

It's the interface that exists on Element that\nlets you start animations on it. These ones are like that but for the\nfour pseudo-elements created by the view transition.\n\nIf a name changes, then a new ref is created. That way if you hold onto\na ref during an exit animation spawned by the name change, you can keep\ncalling functions on it. It will keep referring to the old name rather\nthan the new name.\n\nThis allows imperative control over the animations instead of using CSS\nfor this.\n\n```js\nconst viewTransition = ref.current;\nconst groupAnimation = viewTransition.group.animate(keyframes, options);\nconst imagePairAnimation = viewTransition.imagePair.animate(keyframes, options);\nconst oldAnimation = viewTransition.old.animate(keyframes, options);\nconst newAnimation = viewTransition.new.animate(keyframes, options);\n```\n\nThe downside of using this API is that it doesn't work with SSR so for\nSSR rendered animations they'll fallback to the CSS. You could use this\nfor progressive enhancement though.\n\nNote: In this PR the ref only controls one DOM node child but there can\nbe more than one DOM node in the ViewTransition fragment and they are\njust left to their defaults. We could try something like making the\n`animate()` function apply to multiple children but that could lead to\nsome weird consequences and the return value would be difficult to\nmerge. We could try to maintain an array of Animatable that updates with\nhow ever many things are currently animating but that makes the API more\ncomplicated to use for the simple case. Conceptually this should be like\na fragment so we would ideally combine the multiple children into a\nsingle isolate if we could. Maybe one day the same name could be applied\nto multiple children to create a single isolate. For now I think I'll\njust leave it like this and you're really expect to just use it with one\nDOM node. If you have more than one they just get the default animations\nfrom CSS.\n\nUsing this is a little tricky due timing. In this fixture I just use a\nlayout effect plus rAF to get into the right timing after the\nstartViewTransition is ready. In the future I'll add an event that fires\nwhen View Transitions heuristics fire with the right timing.",

The difference here is that we traverse from the Fragment's fiber at\noperation time instead of keeping a set of children on the\n`FragmentInstance`. We still need to handle newly added or removed child\nnodes to apply event listeners and observers, so we treat those updates\nas effects.\n\n**Fragment Refs**\n\nThis PR extends React's Fragment component to accept a `ref` prop. The\nFragment's ref will attach to a custom host instance, which will provide\nan Element-like API for working with the Fragment's host parent and host\nchildren.\n\nHere I've implemented `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`, and\n`focus` to get started but we'll be iterating on this by adding\nadditional APIs in future PRs. This sets up the mechanism to attach refs\nand perform operations on children. The FragmentInstance is implemented\nin `react-dom` here but is planned for Fabric as well.\n\nThe API works by targeting the first level of host children and proxying\nElement-like APIs to allow developers to manage groups of elements or\nelements that cannot be easily accessed such as from a third-party\nlibrary or deep in a tree of Functional Component wrappers.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Fragment, useRef} from 'react';\n\nconst fragmentRef = useRef(null);\n\n<Fragment ref={fragmentRef}>\n  <div id=\"A\" />\n  <Wrapper>\n    <div id=\"B\">\n      <div id=\"C\" />\n    </div>\n  </Wrapper>\n  <div id=\"D\" />\n</Fragment>\n```\n\nIn this case, calling `fragmentRef.current.addEventListener()` would\napply an event listener to `A`, `B`, and `D`. `C` is skipped because it\nis nested under the first level of Host Component. If another Host\nComponent was appended as a sibling to `A`, `B`, or `D`, the event\nlistener would be applied to that element as well and any other APIs\nwould also affect the newly added child.\n\nThis is an implementation of the basic feature as a starting point for\nfeedback and further iteration.",

Adding new data type `class_instance`: based on prototype chain of an\r\nobject we will check if its plain or not. If not, then will be marked as\r\n`class_instance`. This should not affect `arrays`, ..., because we do\r\nthis in the end of an `object` case in `getDataType` function.\r\n\r\nImportant detail: this approach won't work for objects created with\r\n`Object.create`, because of the custom prototype. This can also be\r\nbypassed by manually deleting a prototype ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\nI am not sure if there might be a better solution (which will cover all\r\ncases) to detect if object is a class instance. Initially I was trying\r\nto use `Object.getPrototypeOf(object) === Object.prototype`, but this\r\nwon't work for cases when we are dealing with `iframe`.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

        "message": "[DevTools] Support Server Components in Tree (#30684)\n\nThis adds VirtualInstances to the tree. Each Fiber has a list of its\r\nparent Server Components in `_debugInfo`. The algorithm is that when we\r\nenter a set of fibers, we actually traverse level 0 of all the\r\n`_debugInfo` in each fiber. Then level 1 of each `_debugInfo` and so on.\r\nIt would be simpler if `_debugInfo` only contained Server Component\r\nsince then we could just look at the index in the array but it actually\r\ncontains other data as well which leads to multiple passes but we don't\r\nexpect it to have a lot of levels before hitting a reified fiber.\r\nFinally when we hit the end a traverse the fiber itself.\r\n\r\nThis lets us match consecutive `ReactComponentInfo` that are all the\r\nsame at the same level. This creates a single VirtualInstance for each\r\nsequence. This lets the same Server Component instance that's a parent\r\nto multiple children appear as a single Instance instead of one per\r\nFiber.\r\n\r\nSince a Server Component's result can be rendered in more than one place\r\nthere's not a 1:1 mapping though. If it is in different parents or if\r\nthe sequence is interrupted, then it gets split into two different\r\ninstances with the same `ReactComponentInfo` data.\r\n\r\nThe real interesting case is what happens during updates because this\r\nalgorithm means that a Fiber can become reparented during an update to\r\nend up in a different VirtualInstance. The ideal would maybe be that the\r\nfrontend could deal with this reparenting but instead I basically just\r\nunmount the previous instance (and its children) and mount a new\r\ninstance which leads to some interesting scenarios. This is inline with\r\nthe strategy I was intending to pursue anyway where instances are\r\nreconciled against the previous children of the same parent instead of\r\nthe `fiberToFiberInstance` map - which would let us get rid of that map.\r\nIn that case the model is resilient to Fiber being in more than one\r\nplace at a time.\r\n\r\nHowever this unmount/remount does mean that we can lose selection when\r\nthis happens. We could maybe do something like using the tracked path\r\nlike I did for component filters. Ideally it's a weird edge case though\r\nbecause you'd typically not have it. The main case that it happens now\r\nis for reorders of list of server components. In that case basically all\r\nthe children move between server components while the server components\r\nthemselves stay in place. We should really include the key in server\r\ncomponents so that we can reconcile them using the key to handle\r\nreorders which would solve the common case anyway.\r\n\r\nI convert the name to the `Env(Name)` pattern which allows the\r\nEnvironment Name to be used as a badge.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1105\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-13 at 9 55 29 PM\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323c20ba-b655-4ee8-84fa-8233f55d2999\">\r\n\r\n(Screenshot is with #30667.

Server\r\nComponents aren't stateful so there's not actually one specific owner\r\nthat it necessarily matches. So it can't be a global look up. E.g. the\r\nsame Server Component can be rendered in two places or even nested\r\ninside each other.\r\n\r\nTherefore we need to find an appropriate instance using a heuristic. We\r\ncan do that by traversing the parent path since the owner is likely also\r\na parent. Not always but almost always.\r\n\r\nTo simplify things we can also do the same for Fibers.

(See this Code Sandbox for a proof of concept.)\r\n\r\nIt also contains the following code cleanup:\r\n* Additional unit tests have been added for modifying values as well as renaming or deleting paths.\r\n* Four new DEV-only methods have been added to the reconciler to be injected into the DevTools hook: overrideHookStateDeletePath, overrideHookStateRenamePath, overridePropsDeletePath, and overridePropsRenamePath. (DevTools will degrade gracefully for older renderers without these methods.)\r\n* I also took this as an opportunity to refactor some of the existing code in a few places:\r\n  * Rather than the backend implementing separate methods for editing props, state, hooks, and context– there are now three methods: deletePath, renamePath, and overrideValueAtPath that accept a type argument to differentiate between props, state, context, or hooks.\r\n  * The various UI components for the DevTools frontend have been refactored to remove some unnecessary repetition.\r\n\r\nThis commit also adds temporary support for override* commands with mismatched backend/frontend versions:\r\n* Add message forwarding for older backend methods (overrideContext, overrideHookState, overrideProps, and overrideState) to the new overrideValueAtPath method. This was done in both the frontend Bridge (for newer frontends passing messages to older embedded backends) and in the backend Agent (for older frontends passing messages to newer backends). We do this because React Native embeds the React DevTools backend, but cannot control which version of the frontend users use.\r\n* Additional unit tests have been added as well to cover the older frontend to newer backend case.

        "message": "refactor[react-devtools]: rewrite context menus (#29049)\n\n## Summary\r\n- While rolling out RDT 5.2.0 on Fusebox, we've discovered that context\r\nmenus don't work well with this environment. The reason for it is the\r\ncontext menu state implementation - in a global context we define a map\r\nof registered context menus, basically what is shown at the moment (see\r\ndeleted Contexts.js file). These maps are not invalidated on each\r\nre-initialization of DevTools frontend, since the bundle\r\n(react-devtools-fusebox module) is not reloaded, and this results into\r\nRDT throwing an error that some context menu was already registered.\r\n- We should not keep such data in a global state, since there is no\r\nguarantee that this will be invalidated with each re-initialization of\r\nDevTools (like with browser extension, for example).\r\n- The new implementation is based on a `ContextMenuContainer` component,\r\nwhich will add all required `contextmenu` event listeners to the\r\nanchor-element. This component will also receive a list of `items` that\r\nwill be displayed in the shown context menu.\r\n- The `ContextMenuContainer` component is also using\r\n`useImperativeHandle` hook to extend the instance of the component, so\r\ncontext menus can be managed imperatively via `ref`:\r\n`contextMenu.current?.hide()`, for example.\r\n- **Changed**: The option for copying value to clipboard is now hidden\r\nfor functions. The reasons for it are:\r\n- It is broken in the current implementation, because we call\r\n`JSON.stringify` on the value, see\r\n`packages/react-devtools-shared/src/backend/utils.js`.\r\n- I don't see any reasonable value in doing this for the user, since `Go\r\nto definition` option is available and you can inspect the real code and\r\nthen copy it.\r\n- We already filter out fields from objects, if their value is a\r\nfunction, because the whole object is passed to `JSON.stringify`.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n### Works with element props and hooks:\r\n- All context menu items work reliably for props items\r\n- All context menu items work reliably or hooks items\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/28902667/5e2d58b0-92fa-4624-ad1e-2bbd7f12678f\r\n\r\n### Works with timeline profiler:\r\n- All context menu items work reliably: copying, zooming, ...\r\n- Context menu automatically closes on the scroll event\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/28902667/de744cd0-372a-402a-9fa0-743857048d24\r\n\r\n### Works with Fusebox:\r\n- Produces no errors\r\n- Copy to clipboard context menu item works reliably\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/28902667/0288f5bf-0d44-435c-8842-6b57bc8a7a24",
